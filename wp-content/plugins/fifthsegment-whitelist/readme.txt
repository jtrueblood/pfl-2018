The Whitelist plugin enables you to open your website to a set of users and blocks everyone else. You can enter users by their email address into the Whitelist tab of the plugin. Once done, only users on the list would be able to visit your site.

== Description ==

Whitelist makes making password-protected / members only wordpress sites a breeze. It creates a Roadblock on your site allowing only whitelisted users to get through. It's also perfect for wordpress websites that are in alpha / beta /testing phase where owners can invite only a specific set of users by email to test out the website. Apart from the Roadblock spam visitors can be blocked by enabling the Recaptcha that this plugin provides.

Once you activate the plugin your website will be blocked to everyone and visitors would be shown a Roadblock page where they can enter their email to visit your site. If their email is on the whitelist they'll be given the option to create a password and login to your site.
